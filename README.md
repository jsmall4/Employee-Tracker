# Employee-Tracker

# Project Description:

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

# Installation:

Run the command: node index to start then use the prompts to navigate the menus to view, add or edit the database.
